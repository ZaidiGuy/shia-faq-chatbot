# Shia Islamic FAQ Assistant

A Flask-based web application that provides Islamic FAQ assistance according to Ja'fari Fiqh using OpenAI's GPT models.

## üêõ Bug Fixes Applied

### ‚úÖ **CRITICAL - Fixed Deprecated OpenAI API Usage**
- **Issue**: Code used `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` which is deprecated in openai>=1.0.0
- **Fix**: Updated to use the new `OpenAI()` client with `client.chat.completions.create()`
- **Impact**: Application now works with latest OpenAI library versions

### ‚úÖ **HIGH SECURITY - Fixed XSS Vulnerability**
- **Issue**: User input and API responses were directly injected into HTML using `innerHTML`
- **Fix**: Replaced with safe DOM manipulation using `textContent` and `createElement`
- **Impact**: Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks

### ‚úÖ **CONFIGURATION - Made API Endpoint Configurable**
- **Issue**: Hardcoded production URL in frontend JavaScript
- **Fix**: Added automatic detection of localhost vs production environment
- **Impact**: Application now works in both development and production environments

### ‚úÖ **RUNTIME - Added Environment Variable Validation**
- **Issue**: No validation for required `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Fix**: Added startup validation with clear error messages
- **Impact**: Application fails fast with helpful error messages if misconfigured
